Reflect on the project, both technical and organizational. What went well? What didn’t 
go well? 

- Our teamwork and communication was very good across the team. We worked together well and got the job done. Our team's designs were well thought out and were rarely half baked during the detail design phase especially. 
- Our ability to work in parallel in the prototype and experimentation phase was not the best. We could work as a group just fine, but when it came to splitting up the work we struggled to divide the work well. Later in the project lifecycle, we had the tendency to rush things and not think things through as much as we did in the detail design phase. This was mainly due to the time crunch of the competition deadline.

What unanticipated problems occurred? 

- The ordering issues were not anticipated at all. I thought some stuff may have shown up late, but I never expected to not get entire subsystems worth of parts. There were also many problems the team ran into at the competition in Orlando such as bricked arduinos, torque issues, path issues, and last minute redesigns.
- There were many issues with solder joints and other connections as well as routing wires within the small chassis of the robot that quickly became a headache.

What would you do differently if you were to do it over again? 

- The team worked very well together, but I wish we were able to work in parallel much better. Typically, we would all work on the same one or two tasks. This slowed our progress quite a bit in hindsight.
- I would not buy a battery with a current limit to control motors in robotics. Going ahead and designing seperate power sources for the controllers and the motors would have saved a lot of headache.
- The wires in the robot were a complete mess due to the rush and it ended up causing many problems when it came to debugging anything wrong with the robot. This issue also caused the robot to not function properly sometimes due to solder joints being bad or wires falling out that we could not see or get to easily.

What “best practices” have you identified? 

- Planning and communication within the team are keys to success. 
- Always double check everything including schematic designs, code, and solder jobs.
- Never assume something will work the first time
- Good decumentation and color coding is a lifesaver for debugging


What words of wisdom would you pass on to future students?

- Be sure to think things through with how one part of a design could effect other parts of the design that most would not think is connected in any way.
- If something doesn't work, it doesn't mean it was pointless. Usually, you learn something valuable even from the failures that come with designing anything.
- It is better to think something through than rush to try to implement it.

What new knowledge or skills did you acquire throughout capstone.

- The importance of the planning phase.
- Basics of ROS and Linux

- How buck/boost converters work

- Reflect on the project, both technical and organizational. What went well? What didn’t go well? 

I think the project was well organized. We had technical issues arise when we faced ordering issues. We faced many technical issues based on deadlines for the competition and had to work to the very end to have a competitive bot at the competition.

- What unanticipated problems occurred? 

We had many unanticipated issues between the conceptual/ detailed design phase and the build phase. The team had ideas of how things would work but in practice they did not work as we intended. We had to adapt to issues as they arose and had to rescope the project due to unforeseen technical issues. 

The team planned for possible issues being aware of the breadth of scope in the problem statement. 

The team overcame many technical issues in the 48 hours leading up the competition including: power redesign, burnt out components, and consumption redesign. 

- What would you do differently if you were to do it over again? 

I would have liked to have all parts ordered earlier given the ordering issues that arose in the second semester. Given the knowledge that I have now looking back on the project and seeing opponents robot strategies, I would have rescoped earlier and built the entire chassis around the idea of being a pusher robot. The winning team at the competition fed the food chips successfully and then had arms that extended and swept the whole arena in one pass and moved all objects to the recycling area. 

- What “best practices” have you identified? 

Good communication and planning are key for a projects success. Ensure that everyone has a subsystem and are able to make contributions using their past experience and specialties. 

Constant communication throughout the process so that systems are able to integrate well when they are integrated and ready to be assembled into the final project. 

- What words of wisdom would you pass on to future students?

Obviously try your hardest to follow best engineering practices when building up the project, but be sure to develop plans for when things break or do not work as intended. Do not give up whenever things break and do not work as intended, develop a strategy with what you have and move forward. 

- What new knowledge or skills did you acquire throughout capstone.

    - Robot operating system (ROS) experience
    - Systems engineering lifecycle and design understanding
    - Project work across disciplines (electrical, computer, and mechanical engineering)
