# **IEEE Southeast con robotics competition**

## **Executive Summary**

The purpose of this project is to build a robot that will be sent to the SoutheastCon student competition in Orlando, Florida. This robot will represent Tennessee Technological University to schools around the Southeastern United States. This document will include further details on the teamâ€™s design for the project.

The autonomous tasks the robot may attempt include the following: Feed manatees and alligators the correct food chips, relocate ducks to the duck pond, rebuild pedestals into statues, deposit any unused objects into the recycle bin, and play an animated fireworks video at the end of the round.

## **Capabilities**

This conceptual design is meant to fit into the larger process of engineering design in that it explains the goal of this project and specific things that any stakeholders should understand. The document sets the team up for detailed design, which will be the next step after this document has been released. This document contains the following fully formulated problem statements, fully decomposed conceptual solution, constraints and where they arise from, how the constraint will be analytically validated, and a detailed design schedule. 

The signoffs include function of the subsystem, constraints, buildable schematics, analysis, and bill of materials.

## **Salient Outcomes (updated 11/30/2022)**

* The team has been able to submit a detailed project proposal which defined the scope, constraints, and stakeholders for the project
* The team created a conceptual design document which laid out how the team will conceptually approach design and led the team into detailed design signoffs. 
* The team has been able to successfully get a signoff approved on the most critical subsystem for the project
  * This is a sort of vertical vacuum cleaner that has been implemented previously in vex robot competitions. It is a very interesting design and has been proven to work. [Demonstration Link](https://youtu.be/RCfMzZY3lC0?t=230)
  
We are just now completing Capstone I and have not begun any implementation or experimentation at this time. Salient outcomes will be updated when notable progress has been made.

### **Faculty Supervisor**

Mr. Jesse Roberts

### **Stakeholders**

The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is the organization that is hosting the competition in Orlando, Florida on April 13-16th, 2023. Stephen Hopkins is the chair of the hardware competition. Tommy Dillen from University of Central Florida (UCF) is the leader of Valencia IEEE Student Chapter design team and designed the arena for the competition.

At the competition, the team will represent the Tennessee Tech ECE Department by showing the skills aquired over most of the ECE curriculum.

Tennessee Technological University's College of Engineering's reputation will be affected by our presence and performance at the competition.

## **Repo Organization**
