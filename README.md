# **IEEE SoutheastCon Robotics Competition**

## **Executive Summary**

The purpose of this project is to build a robot that will be sent to the SoutheastCon student competition in Orlando, Florida. This robot will represent Tennessee Technological University to schools around the Southeastern United States. This document will include further details on the teamâ€™s design for the project.

The autonomous tasks the robot may attempt include the following: Feed manatees and alligators the correct food chips, relocate ducks to the duck pond, rebuild pedestals into statues, deposit any unused objects into the recycle bin, and play an animated fireworks video at the end of the round.

The robot was rescoped throughout the year and just before the competition to be able to meet objective and once we know opponents capabilities at the competition. The final robot implemented was able to feed manatees and alligators the correct food chips, relocate ducks to the duck pond, and to push remaining items to the recycling areas. 

The team placed fourth out of thirty six schools in the competiton, which is the second best performance in Tennessee Tech history. 

## **Capabilities**

The signoffs include function of the subsystem, constraints, buildable schematics, analysis, and bill of materials.

## **Salient Outcomes**

* The team has been able to submit a detailed project proposal which defined the scope, constraints, and stakeholders for the project
* The team created a conceptual design document which laid out how the team will conceptually approach design and led the team into detailed design signoffs. 
* The team has been able to successfully get a signoff approved on the most critical subsystem for the project
  * This is a sort of vertical vacuum cleaner that has been implemented previously in vex robot competitions. It is a very interesting design and has been proven to work. [Demonstration Link](https://youtu.be/RCfMzZY3lC0?t=230)

The team believes that one salient outcome of this project is a platform for understanding robot operating system for future SECON competitions at Tennessee Tech, and other robotics projects undertaken by capstone groups at the University. This is specifically referring to the TCP/IP network communication established in this project between the Jetson Nano and Arduino Mega2560. 

This project was the closest ever integration of the Mechanical Engineering Department's Senior Design course and the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department's Capstone course. These courses are based around an all-encompassing project from what students have learned in University. The team and its advisors has learned a lot about what has worked and what can be improved with this format of project, and this lessons learned will be taken into the future with the students graduating and for those advisors with future groups.

### **Faculty Supervisor**

Mr. Jesse Roberts

### **Stakeholders**

The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is the organization that is hosting the competition in Orlando, Florida on April 13-16th, 2023. Stephen Hopkins is the chair of the hardware competition. Tommy Dillen from Valencia College is the leader of Valencia IEEE Student Chapter design team and designed the arena for the competition.

At the competition, the team will represent the Tennessee Tech ECE Department by showing the skills acquired over most of the ECE curriculum.

Tennessee Technological University's College of Engineering's reputation will be affected by our presence and performance at the competition.
