# IEEE Southeast con robotics competition

## Executive Summary

Give the elevator pitch and abstract for the project. It should allow interested visitors to broadly understand the motivation for the project and what the project has accomplished.

The purpose of this project is to build a robot that will be sent to the SoutheastCon student competition in Orlando, Florida. This robot will represent Tennessee Technological University to schools around the Southeastern United States. This document will include further details on the teamâ€™s conceptual design for the project. 

## Capabilities

Here explain in more detail (though not as much as will be given in the datasheet) what the version of this project in this repo is capable of doing.

This conceptual design is meant to fit into the larger process of engineering design in that it explains the goal of this project and specific things that any stakeholders should understand. The document sets the team up for detailed design, which will be the next step after this document has been released. This document contains the following fully formulated problem statements, fully decomposed conceptual solution, constraints and where they arise from, how the constraint will be analytically validated, and a detailed design schedule. 

## Salient Outcomes

Projects often have some outcomes that are more interesting than others. Here, highlight those things that you found interesting!

### Faculty Supervisor

Mr. Jesse Roberts

### Stakeholders

Tell a bit about the customer for the project. Also discuss any other groups (specific or general) that are expected to be impacted by the project.

The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is the organization that is hosting the competition in Orlando, Florida on April 13-16th, 2023.

At the competition, the team will represent the Tennessee Tech ECE Department by showing the skills aquired over most of the ECE curriculum.
