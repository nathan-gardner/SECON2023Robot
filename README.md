![image](/Documentation/Images/finalcadmodel.png)

## **Executive Summary**

The purpose of this project is to build a robot that will be sent to the SoutheastCon student competition in Orlando, Florida. This robot will represent Tennessee Technological University to schools around the Southeastern United States. This document will include further details on the teamâ€™s design for the project.

The autonomous tasks the robot may attempt include the following: Feed manatees and alligators the correct food chips, relocate ducks to the duck pond, rebuild pedestals into statues, deposit any unused objects into the recycle bin, and play an animated fireworks video at the end of the round.

The robot was rescoped throughout the year and just before the competition to be able to meet objective and once we know opponents capabilities at the competition. The final robot implemented was able to feed manatees and alligators the correct food chips, relocate ducks to the duck pond, and to push remaining items to the recycling areas. 

The team placed fourth out of thirty six schools in the competition, which is the second best performance in Tennessee Tech history. The team sees this as a success considering the ordering setbacks experienced by all the Capstone teams during the Spring 2023 semester, and the scope changes that were necessary to meet deadlines for the competition. 

## **Capabilities**

The signoffs include function of the subsystem, constraints, buildable schematics, analysis, and bill of materials.

The path that this robot follows is defined in [top_level.py](/Software/top-level/top_level_package/scripts/top_level.py) and is all relative to the starting area. The distance is measured using encoder clicks and directions are published within the ROS computation graph. This means the robot cannot observe its surroundings and react to its surroundings, but can only go point to point based on the code within that top_level.py file. This was fine for our street sweeper implementation, and was a necessity in design because none of our vision sensors that we ordered came in the mail. This path implementation was reliable across runs. The direction publications were formatted as ROS Twist messages which gave direction and velocity in rotations per minute. The RPM was maintained on the Arduino using a custom PID controller written in C++. 

## **Salient Outcomes**

* The team has been able to submit a detailed project proposal which defined the scope, constraints, and stakeholders for the project
* The team created a conceptual design document which laid out how the team will conceptually approach design and led the team into detailed design signoffs. 
* The team has been able to successfully get a signoff approved on the most critical subsystem for the project
  * This is a sort of vertical vacuum cleaner that has been implemented previously in vex robot competitions. It is a very interesting design and has been proven to work. [Demonstration Link](https://youtu.be/RCfMzZY3lC0?t=230)

The team believes that one salient outcome of this project is a platform for understanding robot operating system for future SECON competitions at Tennessee Tech, and other robotics projects undertaken by capstone groups at the University. This is specifically referring to the TCP/IP network communication established in this project between the Jetson Nano and Arduino Mega2560. 

This project was the closest ever integration of the Mechanical Engineering Department's Senior Design course and the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department's Capstone course. These courses are based around an all-encompassing project from what students have learned in University. The team and its advisors has learned a lot about what has worked and what can be improved with this format of project, and this lessons learned will be taken into the future with the students graduating and for those advisors with future groups.  

## **Project Demonstration & Images**

Below are some images that show the team's progress so far on the project.

### **Playing Field**

#### **Description of Arena:**

- Feeding areas - green and red rectangles in the left corners of the arena
- Starting area - White square in the bottom center of the arena
- Duck Pond - Blue circle in the middle of the top section of the arena
- Recycling areas - Striped white rectangles in the right corners of the arena
- Fireworks switch - Silver rectangle on the right side of the arena
- Inner circles - Three located to the left and right of the starting area, as well as in the middle of the duck pond

#### **Areas utilized for points during competition**

- Feeding areas - Most of our teams points came from correctly delivering the food chips to the feeding areas consistently.  
- Recycling areas - Where the robot pushed loose and randomly placed items to gain points. 
- Duck pond - Ducks ended up in the duck pond during competition. This counted for points on the scoreboard. 

## **Subsystems**
- [Feeding](/Documentation/Signoffs/LukeMcGill-signoff-Feeding.md) - Delivered chips to correct area using servos.
- [Locomotion](/Documentation/Signoffs/LukeMcGill-signoff-Locomotion.md) - Transported robot using mecanum wheels.
- [Power](/Documentation/Signoffs/MarkBeech-MadisonKelly-signoff-Power.md) - Powered every system with two 6V batteries and a 12 V battery.
- [Low-level Controller](/Documentation/Signoffs/NathanGardner-signoff-LowlevelController.md) - Arduino Mega2560 was selected as the main motor controller. 
- [Top-level Controller](/Documentation/Signoffs/NathanGardner-signoff-ToplevelController.md) - Nvidia Jetson selected for computation power as compared to Raspberry Pi.
- [Delivery System](/Documentation/Signoffs/Team2-signoff-ConsumptionSubsystem.md) - pushed objects outward when near a recycling area.

## **Cut Subsystems with explanation**
- [Vision](/Documentation/Signoffs/Fatima-signoff-vision.md) - Sensors were not received in time for building. The team ordered LIDAR sensor and color sensors and they never arrived.
- [Duck Storage](/Documentation/Signoffs/MadisonKelly-signoff-DuckStorage.md) - Subsystem cut as part of the rollback a few days before the competition. We did not have consistency in delivering the ducks stored to the duck pond reliably. A risk reward analysis was done and it was voted on by the team to remove the subsystem entirely. 
- [Pedestal Storage and Delivery](/Documentation/Signoffs/MadisonKelly-signoff-PedestalStorageAndDelivery.md) - Parts were not received in time for building. 
- [Sorting](/Documentation/Signoffs/MarkBeech-signoff-Sorting.md) - Parts were not received in time for building. Sorting was cut when rescoping once we realized we were not receiving parts for many of the subsystems we ordered. 
- [Consumption -> Delivery Subsystem](/Documentation/Signoffs/Team2-signoff-ConsumptionSubsystem.md) - Rescoped 24 hours before the competition. The function was transitioned from consumption into the robot to ejection into the recycling area.
